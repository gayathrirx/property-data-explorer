An interactive web application that transforms raw property data into actionable insights. This tool harnesses the power of the **ATTOM Data API** for real-time property records and leverages a **Google FLAN-T5 Large Language Model** from the Hugging Face Hub to perform demographic analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This application offers two primary features, accessible through a clean, tabbed interface:

### 1. Detailed Property Lookup
Instantly retrieve a comprehensive profile for any property in the United States. Simply enter a full address to get a detailed report including:
- **Ownership & Location:** Current owner names, Parcel ID (APN), and subdivision details.
- **Valuation & Tax:** The latest market value, assessed value, and annual tax information.
- **Sale History:** The most recent sale price and date.
- **Building Characteristics:** Property type, year built, living area, and bed/bath count.



### 2. AI-Powered Demographic Analysis
Uncover demographic trends within any ZIP code. This feature performs a complex, real-time analysis:
1.  Fetches a sample of 100 Single Family Residences from the ATTOM API based on the user's ZIP code.
2.  Performs a second set of API calls to retrieve the owner's full name for each property.
3.  Uses a **Google FLAN-T5 Large Language Model** to predict the likely national origin of each owner's name.
4.  Generates a dynamic, interactive pie chart visualizing the predicted demographic distribution.




### ‚ö°Ô∏è Advanced Capabilities
- **Efficient Caching:** Implements a persistent, encrypted, file-based cache for both API calls and AI predictions. Subsequent requests for the same data are nearly instantaneous.
- **Real-time Feedback:** A dynamic progress bar and status messages keep the user informed during complex, multi-step analyses.
- **Secure by Design:** All sensitive credentials (API keys, encryption keys) are managed securely using Hugging Face Repository Secrets. Data at rest in the cache is encrypted using the `cryptography` library.
